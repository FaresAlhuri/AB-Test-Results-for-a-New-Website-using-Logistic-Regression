# AB-Test-Results-for-a-New-Website-using-Logistic-Regression
## Project Overview

For this project, I  analyzed the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce company as part of the **Udacity Nanodegree in Data Analysis**. The company developed a new webpage to potentially increase user conversionsâ€”meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 

The **goal** was to determine whether the company should:

1. Implement the new page
2. Retain the old one
3. or extend the experiment to gather more data before making a decision.  

Throughout the project, I followed a structured approach to ensure my findings were statistically sound. While completing the quizzes was not mandatory for the project, I **ensured that all the items on the **Project Rubric** met the required specifications** for successful completion and results.

## Summary  

In this project, I analyzed an A/B test for an e-commerce company as part of the **Udacity Nanodegree in Data Analysis** to determine whether a new webpage design improves user conversion rates compared to the old page.
