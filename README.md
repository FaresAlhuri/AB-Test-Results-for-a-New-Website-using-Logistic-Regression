# AB-Test-Results-for-a-New-Website-using-Logistic-Regression
## Project Overview

For this project, I worked on analyzing the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce company as part of the **Udacity Nanodegree in Data Analysis**. The company developed a new webpage to potentially increase user conversionsâ€”meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to determine whether the company should implement the new page, retain the old one, or extend the experiment to gather more data before making a decision.  

The dataset and Jupyter Notebook provided all the necessary files for the analysis. Throughout the project, I followed a structured approach to ensure my findings were statistically sound. Additionally, some parts of the notebook referenced quizzes from the course to help verify my understanding of key concepts. While completing the quizzes was not mandatory for the project, I **ensured that all the items on the **Project Rubric** met the required specifications** for successful completion.

## Summary  

In this project, I analyzed an A/B test for an e-commerce company as part of the **Udacity Nanodegree in Data Analysis** to determine whether a new webpage design improves user conversion rates compared to the old page.
